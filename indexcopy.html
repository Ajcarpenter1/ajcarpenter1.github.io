<p>Aliens have been around for many years. Who knows they could actually be living among us as we speak. The myth around Aliens being real or not has been up in the air and I am here to bring light to the situation. They are real. All of the videos and sighting around this topic have been unknown as to what they are or why they are here. Why they are here is something we can't answer quite yet but one day we will have the answers to. Come along on this journey as we look deeper into Alien existence and their reason for wanting to be on our earth!</p>
