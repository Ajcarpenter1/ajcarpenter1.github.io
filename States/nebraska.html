            <h2>First Impression</h2>
            
            <p> The first thing I noticed when I clicked on the Nebraska website was all of the different colors. I think it was really appealing to the viewer's eye. There is a nice image of the city as the background  and the colors of the page compliment that picture.The website is compatible for cellphones and the text size gets bigger as the screen shrinks making it easier to read on a cell phone. </p>
            
            <h2>Colors</h2>
         <p> The colors of the entire website are awesome. The tabs each have their own colors that still compliment the entire website. It is a very interactive website that makes you want to click more and find out more about Nebraska. </p>
            
            <h2>Design</h2>
            
            <p> I think the design of this website is really good. When you click on the tabs it takes you to that tab page and then gives you options on different topics that people look for under those tabs. The options on each page are also interactive and very big making it easier to use for cell phones. </p>
            
            <h2>Navigation</h2>
