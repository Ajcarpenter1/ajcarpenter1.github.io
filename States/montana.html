    <h1>Montana</h1>
    
        <ul>
        
        <li><a href="http://mt.gov" target="_new" title="Montana's Website">Montana's Website.</a></li>

        </ul>
            
            <h2>First impression</h2>
            
            <p> The first think I noticed about this website is that color of the text and blocks are pretty dull which take away from the background image. </p>
            
            <h2>Compatibility/Navigation</h2>
            
            <p> The website is compatible with cellphone usage and the text is fairly large so it would be easy to use with a cellphone. The margins on the tabs make it easier to use on a cellphone as well. The website was easy to naviagte through and was easy to find what you were looking for.</p>
            
            <h2>Design</h2>
            
            <p> There aren't very many images when you click on the tabs, so I would say the design is poor in that aspect because it is just a bunch of text and it would lose a viewers interest.</p>
            
            <h2>Colors</h2>
            
            <p> The colors of the pages are also dull taking away from the background image. The page margin is pretty big as well only slightly showing off the colors of the images behind them.</p>
            
            <h2>Coding</h2>
            
            <p>The coding for the Montana website is very organized and easy to navigate through if you were trying to add something to the code or fix something.</p>
            
            
            <h2>I like this website</h2>
            
            
            <p> Overall, I like the website and think its easy to naviage through it jsut needs some nex text and block colors. </p>
