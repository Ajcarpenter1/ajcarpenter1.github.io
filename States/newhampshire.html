        <h2>First Impression</h2>
    
        <p> My first impression of this website was that it has very boring repetitve colors. It reminds me a lot of the Alaska website. It is also not compatible with cell phones when you shrink the size of the web page. </p>
        
        <h2>Colors</h2>
        
        <p> The website has the same boring colors all throughout its pages. This does not attract the viewer's eye. The colors do not pop at all and are very dull.</p>
        
        <h2>Design</h2>
        
        <p> I think the design is kind of poor and basic. It does not seem like a lot of time or effort were put into this website. I find it very strange that some of the tabs are compatible with cell phone usage but others are not. There needs to be more consistency within the website. The tabs have pretty large margins making it easier for cell phones.</p>
     
        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        
        <p>I got very confused when trying to find my way through the website. I could not figure out how to get back to the home page from the tabs and when I clicked on the New Hampshire logo in the top left hand corner, it took me to a completely different page, not even the home page. </p>
        
        <h2>Coding</h2>
        
        <p>The coding isn't super organzied but it is somewhat organized to find your way around if you needed to add something or fix something.</p>
        
        <h2> I do not like this website</h2>
        
        <p>Overall, I do not like this website. I think there are too many inconsistencies within the webpage and its hard to navigate through and find what you are looking for.</p>
