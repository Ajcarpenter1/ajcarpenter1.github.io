    <h1>Alaska</h1>
         
         <ul>
    

             <li><a href="http://Alaska.gov" target="_new" title="Alaska's Website"> Alaska's Website.</a></li>
             <li><a href="ranks.html">State Website Rankings</a></li>
         
         </ul>
         
         <h2>First impression</h2>
         
         <p> The first thing that caught my eye when looking at Alaska's state website is that it is not compatible with cellphones. When I shrunk the screen, you had to scroll to see the other side of the page. </p>
          
         <h2>Colors</h2>
         
         <p> The colors on the page I think are basic and bland. It doesn't make the page pop or make me want to continue through the website. </p>
         
         <h2>Design</h2>
         
         <p> The design of the website also is not compatible with cellphone usage because when you go to click on the tabs at the top, the margins are fairly small so anyone planning to navigate through this website on their cell phones would have a rough time trying to click the tab. </p>
         
         <h2>Menu</h2>
         
         <p>Some of the links and resources on their website take you to pages that don't exist anymore so there is another flaw. </p>
    
         <h2>Coding</h2>
         
         <p>The coding looks very scattered and unorganized. It would be hard to try to find a certain part of the code if you were trying to fix something or add something.</p>
         
         <h2>Navigation</h2>
         
         <p> Finally, navigating through their webiste there is just a lot to read and tiny print. There are hardly any pictures representing the state or any of the tabs. </p>
         
         
         <h2>I do not like this website</h2>
         <p> overall, I do not like this website, it is too complicated.</p>
