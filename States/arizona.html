        <ul>


            
            <li><a href="http://az.gov" target="_new" title="Arizona's Website"> Arizona's Website.</a></li>

        <h2>First impression</h2>
     <p> When I first opened Arizona's website it was very engaging right away. the images that you first see and the background of the website make it look like they spent a lot of time making this website look presentable. The website is also compatible with cell phone usage so that is another bonus. </p>
        
        <h2>Menu</h2>
        
        <p> When I go to click on the tabs, the margins are wide enough that you would be able to click the tabs while using a cell phone. </p>
        
        <h2>Design</h2>
        
        <p> The design of the website looks good and the colors and images on each page make the website pop. </p>
        
        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        
        <p> The website is easy to navigate through and isn't confusing to find where you want to go. The tabs at the top are pretty straight forward with the common things people search on state websites.</p>
        
        <h2>Coding</h2>
        
        <p> The coding looks more organized than most and looks fairly easy to navigate through if you were trying to find where to add things or fix things.</p>
        
        <h2>This is a good website</h2>
        
        <p> Overall, I really like this website and think if I was trying to find something and look up things in Arizona and what they can offer, I would be very pleased. </p>
