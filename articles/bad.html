            <h1> Bad Website Review </h1>

            <p><img src="pennyjuice.png" class="officer"></p>

            <p>This website is called Penny Juice. This website is about healthier less concentrated juices for children. The first thing that caught my eye when I went to the home page of the website was a note saying page not found. This was on the actual website so maybe they forget to add the homepage into the actual website when it was launched or it just no longer exists.</p>

            <p>This website has so much going on with the colors, the background images, and the use of several different fonts on one page. </p>

            <p>The coding for the website is very scattered and not organized at all. There are several points of blank space in the coding. They do not use tables in their website.</p>

            <p>The colors of this website are red, blue, yellow, green, purple. All of the colors are very bold and bright which take away from the website. The background image is of two children playing with what looks like Play-Doh. The colors of the website and the background image clash a lot. </p>

            <p>The website only has 3 tabs in the navigation. They are the home tab, juice tab, and order tab. the navigation for this site is easy to use. I noticed on the juice tab they also have an order button at the button which wouldn't make sense to havw the order tab. I think they could have put juice information only on the juice tab.</p>

            <p>The only thing that sets this website apart from others is that it is awful looking.</p>

            <p> I would not reccomend going to this site, but if you want more information on juice for chidlren then the link is provided. <a href="http://pennyjuice.com" target="_new" Title="Penny Juices Website">Penny Juices.</a></p>
